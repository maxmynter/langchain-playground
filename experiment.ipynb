As our under-\\nstanding has increased, so have our theories changed: Geome trical optics, wave optics and quantum\\noptics are increasingly sophisticated descriptions, each referring to a larger class of phenomena than\\nits predecessor. But how exactly are these theories related ? How and when wave optics reduces to\\ngeometric optics is a rather simple problem. Similarly, how quantum optics reduces to wave optics\\nhas been considered to be a very simple business as well. It’s not so. As we show here the classical\\nlimit of quantum optics is a far more complicated issue; it is in fact dramatically more involved and\\nit requires a complete revision of all our intuitions. The re vised intuitions can then serve as a guide\\nto ﬁnding novel quantum eﬀects.\\nInventing a new theory of nature requires, as R. Feyn-\\nmansaid, “imaginationinaterriblestrait-jacket”[1]. Un-\\nliketheartistwhoneed notobeyconstraints,asscientists\\nwe are not free to imagine whatever we want - the new\\ntheory must obey a “correspondence principle”. It must,\\nobviously, give diﬀerent predictions from those of the old\\ntheoryforsomephenomena, but at thesametime it must\\nagree with the old theory in all the places in which the\\nold theory was already experimentally veriﬁed. For all\\nthose experiments the new theory must give numerical\\nresults that are very similar to those of the old theory;\\nthe only acceptable diﬀerence must be smaller than the\\nprecision of the measurements that seemed to conﬁrm\\nthe old theory.\\nInsofar as the numerical predictions of a theory are\\nconcerned, the correspondence principle is fairly obvi-\\nous and straightforward. However, theories are not only\\nmathematical devices for making numerical predictions -\\nthey contain concepts that tell us a story of what the na-\\nture of physical reality is. And, as Feynman also noted,\\neven in situations when the numerical predictions of two\\ntheories are almost identical, the concepts they involve\\nmay be completely diﬀerent. Indeed, it is a fundamental\\nconceptual diﬀerence between, say, mass being an abso-\\nlute constant or mass changingwith the speed even when\\nthe speed is so low that the change of mass is negligible.\\nYet, and this is the point that concerns us here, al-\\nthough the concepts of the two theories are completely\\ndiﬀerent, andremaindiﬀerentevenintheregimeinwhich\\nthe two theories give almost identical numerical predic-\\ntions, it seems to be the case that the story told by the\\nnew theory relates in rather simple waysto the story told\\nby the old theory. For example, although mass changes\\nwith speed, at low speeds it changes only very little -\\nit has a certain simple continuity relation with the old\\nstory of absolute constant mass. It doesn’t have to be so\\n- there is no need of any “continuity” at the conceptual\\nlevel, only the numerical predictions have to agree in theregime where the old theory was already veriﬁed - but\\nthe history of science seems to suggest that this is always\\nthe case.\\nEventhe classicallimit ofquantummechanicsseemsto\\nbe rather benign - with increasing mass, wavepacketscan\\nbe taken narrower and narrower yet they will take longer\\nandlongertospread,soparticlescanbebetterandbetter\\nlocalized. Wavepackets will then follow trajectories very\\nclose to the classical ones. As we show here however,\\nthis benign behavior is only an illusion: we will present\\na situation (in the context of optics) where the classical\\nlimit of quantum mechanics tells a conceptual story that\\nis dramatically diﬀerent from that of classical physics.\\nAn essential point to emphasize is that this whole dis-\\ncussion is not just restricted to interpretations. Quite\\nthe opposite. Allowing us to have a better intuition is\\nessential for ﬁnding new and interesting quantum eﬀects\\nand may lead to new experiments and potential practical\\napplications.\\nTo start with, consider a beam of monochromatic light\\nof frequency ωand high intensity Iimpinging on a mir-\\nror at an angle αas illustrated in Fig.1. Suppose the\\nbeam has unit area and the experiment lasts a unit time.\\nClassically, light is a wave and it carries a momentum\\nproportional to its intensity. Upon reﬂecting from the\\nmirror, it gives the mirror in each unit of time a momen-\\ntum kick\\nδpM= 2Icosα, (1)\\nequal to twice the component of the momentum normal\\nto the mirror (for simplicity, throughout of this paper we\\ntake the speed of light c= 1). Quantum mechanically\\nthe story is diﬀerent. Light consist of photons, each car-\\nryinga momentum p=/planckover2pi1ω. The quantum state that best\\ndescribes the physics of light in this “classical” regime is\\nthe so called “coherent state” [2, 3], which is a superpo-\\nsition of diﬀerent photon numbers with average number\\nnand spread ∆ n=√\\nn. All photons behave in an iden-', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/classical-limit-of-quantum-optics.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='2\\nFIG. 1: Light reﬂected on a mirror\\ntical way: Each photon bounces oﬀ the mirror and gives\\nit a momentum kick, and the total average momentum\\nimparted to the mirror is ntimes the momentum given\\nby each photon\\nδpM= 2n/planckover2pi1ωcosα. (2)\\nGiven that the intensity of light is I=n/planckover2pi1ω, the momen-\\ntum kick calculated quantum mechanically is identical to\\nthe classical one.\\nAlthough the classical and quantum stories are diﬀer-\\nent, theyseemneverthelessquite closetoeachother. Fol-\\nlowing this paradigmaticexample, it is tempting to think\\nthat the classical-quantum transition follows a rather\\nsimple pattern. Nothing, however, can be further from\\nthe truth, as we show below.\\nConsider the interferometric experiment described in\\nFig.2. The three mirrors used in the experiment are per-\\nfectly reﬂecting, with mirror M being silvered on both\\nsides. The diﬀerence between this arrangement and a\\nstandard interferometer is that one of the beams emerg-\\ning from the interferometer, does not directly enter the\\ncorresponding detector (D 1). Rather, it is ﬁrst reﬂected\\nby a supplementary mirroronto the mirrorM which then\\nreﬂects it towards the detector. Mirror M receives there-\\nfore two momentum kicks, one from the light inside the\\ninterferometer and one from the beam that reﬂects on it\\nfrom the outside. The focus ofinterest in this experiment\\nis the momentum received by the mirror M.\\nThe incidence angles of the inside and outside light\\nbeams onto M are chosen such that cos β=1\\n2cosα. The\\nbeamsplitters BS 1and BS 2are identical, having reﬂec-\\ntivityrand transmissivity t, both given by real numbers\\nwithr2+t2= 1, and r > t. Using the standard conven-\\ntion, an incoming state |in/angbracketrightimpinging on the beamsplit-\\nter will emerge as a superposition of a reﬂected state |R/angbracketright\\nand a transmitted state |T/angbracketright;|in/angbracketright →ir|R/angbracketright+t|T/angbracketright. Hence\\nwhen a single photon impinges from the left on BS 1, as\\nillustrated in Fig. 2, the eﬀect of the beamsplitter is to\\nproduce inside the interferometer the state\\n|Ψ/angbracketright=ir|A/angbracketright+t|B/angbracketright (3)FIG. 2: Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one output beam\\nreﬂected back onto the exterior side of mirror M.\\nwhere|A/angbracketrightand|B/angbracketrightdenote the photon propagating along\\ntheAandBarms of the interferometer respectively.\\nThe second beamsplitter, BS 2, is identical to the ﬁrst.\\nAs one can readily check, a photon in the quantum state\\n|Φ1/angbracketright=t|A/angbracketright−ir|B/angbracketrightimpinging on the second beamsplit-\\nter, emerges towards detector D 1while a photon in the\\northogonal state |Φ2/angbracketright=−ir|A/angbracketright+t|B/angbracketrightemerges towards\\ndetector D 2.\\nThus, when a single photon enters the interferometer\\nby impinging on the left side of the beamsplitter BS 1,\\nthe probabilities to be found in the arms AandBarer2\\nandt2respectively. The probability of emerging towards\\ndetector D 1is/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketleftΦ1|Ψ/angbracketright/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2= 4r2t2while the probability of\\nemergingtowardsD 2is/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketleftΦ2|Ψ/angbracketright/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2= (r2−t2)2= 1−4r2t2.\\nSuppose now that we send a classical light beam of\\nintensity Itowards this interferometer. Given the above\\nsettings, the intensity of light in arm AisIA=r2Iwhile\\nthe intensity in arm BisIB=t2I. The intensities of the\\noutput beams are ID1= 4r2t2IandID2= (1−4r2t2)I.\\nAgain, let the beam have a unit area and the experi-\\nmentlastaunittime. Toﬁndthemomentumgiventothe\\nmirror is straightforward. The momentum given by the\\nbeam inside the interferometer is 2 IBcosα= 2t2Icosα.\\nThe momentum given by the beam hitting the mirror\\nfrom the outside is 2 ID1cosβ= 8r2t2Icosβ. The total\\nmomentum is thus\\nδpM= 2t2I(cosα−4r2cosβ).

Thecalculationabovewasdoneusing\\nclassical optics, but a straightforward quantum calcula-\\ntion obviously leads to the same result. The issue how-\\never is with the story each theory has to tell. According\\nto the classical optics description of the experiment, the\\nstoryis very simple. Lightimpinges on M from two sides.\\nAlthoughtheexternalbeamhasashallowerincidencean-\\ngle than the inside beam, its intensity is much higher and\\noverallthemomentumkickgivenbyitislarger,hencethe\\nmirroris pushed inwards. We thereforeconclude that the\\nexternal beam impinging on M plays the central role - it\\nis due to it that the mirror is pushed inwards. Hence one\\nwould be tempted to assume that quantum mechanically\\nthe photons that constitute this beam are the ones re-\\nsponsible for the inward push. Remarkably, this is not\\nso.\\nLet us now analyze in detail the momentum given to\\nthe mirror by the photons that end up at D 1and at\\nD2. Each photon incident on M gives it a momentum\\nkickδ. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that each individual\\nmomentum kick is much smaller than the spread ∆ of\\nmomentum of the mirror. This is a general property of\\nany interferometer. It has to be so in order to maintain\\nthe coherenceofthe light inthe interferometer; otherwise\\nthe photons will become entangled with the mirror. To\\nshowthis, wenotethataphotonwhengoingthrougharm\\nA will produce no kick to M while when going through\\narm B will produce a kick. Accordingly, if φ(p) is the ini-\\ntial quantum state of the mirror and by |Ψ/angbracketrightthe quantum\\nstate of the photon after the input beamsplitter BS1, but\\nbefore reaching the mirror, the reﬂection on the mirror\\nresults in\\n|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p) = (ir|A/angbracketright+t|B/angbracketright)φ(p)→ir|A/angbracketrightφ(p)+t|B/angbracketrightφ(p−δ).\\n(6)\\nIfφ(p) is orthogonal to φ(p−δ) whereδ= 2/planckover2pi1ωcosαis\\nthe kick given by the photon, then the photon ends up\\nentangled with the mirror and coherence is lost. Another\\nway of looking at this is to note that the mirror has to be\\nlocalized within a distance smaller than the wavelength\\nof light, otherwise there will be phase ﬂuctuations larger\\nthan 2πand interference is lost. (In fact the spread ∆\\nin the momentum of the mirror has to be many times\\nbigger - of order√\\nntimes - than that of an individual\\nkick to ensure coherence when a beam with an averageof\\nnphotons and a spread√\\nngoes through the interferom-\\neter. At the same time ∆, being of order√\\nnδ, is smallenough so that the average kick, which is of order nδis\\ndetectable.)\\nFor simplicity we take the state of the mirror to be\\n(up to normalisation) φ(p) = exp(−p2\\n2∆2). Consider now\\na single photon propagating through the interferometer.\\nGiven that δ≪∆, we can approximate the state (6) of\\nthe photon and mirror just before the photon reaches the\\noutput beamsplitter by\\n|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p)≈ir|A/angbracketrightφ(p) +t|B/angbracketright/parenleftBig\\nφ(p)−dφ(p)\\ndpδ/parenrightBig\\n=|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p)−t|B/angbracketrightdφ(p)\\ndpδ. (7)\\nSuppose now that the photon emerges in the beam\\ndirected towards D 1. The state of the mirror is then\\ngiven (up to normalisation) by projecting the joint state\\nonto the state of the photon corresponding to this beam,\\ni.e.\\n/angbracketleftΦ1|/parenleftBig\\n|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p)−t|B/angbracketrightdφ(p)\\ndpδ/parenrightBig\\n=/angbracketleftΦ1|Ψ/angbracketright/parenleftBig\\nφ(p)−t/angbracketleftΦ1|B/angbracketright\\n/angbracketleftΦ1|Ψ/angbracketrightdφ(p)\\ndpδ/parenrightBig\\n=/angbracketleftΦ1|Ψ/angbracketright/parenleftBig\\nφ(p)−/angbracketleftΦ1|PB|Ψ/angbracketright\\n/angbracketleftΦ1|Ψ/angbracketrightdφ(p)\\ndpδ/parenrightBig\\n=/angbracketleftΦ1|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p−Pw\\nBδ).

In other words, a photon that emerges in the\\nD1beam changes the mirror by δpM=1\\n2δ=/planckover2pi1ωcosα.\\nThis momentum changeis a resultofthe mirrorreceiving\\nasuperposition between a kick δand no kick at all, cor-\\nresponding to the photon propagating through the two\\narms.\\nThe appearance in the above of the weak value of the\\nprojector PBis not accidental. Indeed, we can view the\\nmirror as a measuring device measuring whether or not\\nthe photon is in arm B or not. The momentum of the\\nmirror acts as a “pointer” (no kick - the photon is in arm\\nA; kick - the photon is in arm B). However, since the\\nphoton can only change the position of the pointer (i.e.\\nthe momentum of the mirror) by far less than its spread,\\nwe are in the so called “weak measurement” regime [4].', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/classical-limit-of-quantum-optics.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4\\nSo far, we discussed the kick given to the mirror by\\nphotons which eventually emerges towards D1, by the\\ncollision inside the interferometer. After leaving the in-\\nterferometer towards D 1the photon gives another kick\\nto the mirror, this time from the exterior. This kick is\\nsimply 2/planckover2pi1ωcosβ. Recalling that cos β=1\\n2cosαwe reach\\nthe crucial point of our paper: the total kick given to the\\nmirror by a photon that ends up in D 1is\\nδpM=/planckover2pi1ωcosα−2/planckover2pi1ωcosβ= 0. (10)\\nSince the above experiment is in the linear optics regime,\\nthe conclusion reached above for a single photon is valid\\nfor all the photons that end up at D 1: none of them gives\\nan overall kick to the mirror.\\nThen who gives the mirror its momentum? The pho-\\ntons that emerge towards D 2. Indeed, the state of the\\nmirror in this case can be computed by a calculation\\nsimilar to the one above, by simply replacing /angbracketleftΦ1|by\\n/angbracketleftΦ2|.\\nThe state of the mirror can be readily found to be\\n/angbracketleftΦ2|(|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p)−t|B/angbracketrightdφ(p)\\ndpδ)\\n=/angbracketleftΦ2|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p−Pw\\nBδ) (11)\\nwithPw\\nBbeing in this case the weak value of PBbetween\\n|Ψ/angbracketrightand|Φ2/angbracketright,\\nPw\\nB=/angbracketleftΦ2|PB|Ψ/angbracketright\\n/angbracketleftΦ2|Ψ/angbracketright=(ir/angbracketleftA|+t/angbracketleftB|)PB(ir|A/angbracketright+t|B/angbracketright)\\n(ir/angbracketleftA|+t/angbracketleftB|)(ir|A/angbracketright+t|B/angbracketright)\\n=−t2\\nr2−t2. (12)\\nHence the momentum kick received by the mirror due to\\na photon emerging towards D 2is\\nδpM=Pw\\nBδ=−t2\\nr2−t22/planckover2pi1ωcosα. (13)\\nFinally, the total momentum given to the mirror by all\\nthe photonsemergingtowardsD 2is givenby the momen-\\ntum due to each photon times the number of photons in\\nthe beam. Using the fact that the probabilityofa photon\\nto end in this beam is ( r2−t2)2we obtain\\nδpM=n(r2−t2)2−t2\\nr2−t22/planckover2pi1ωcosα=−2t2/planckover2pi1ωn(r2−t2)cosα\\n(14)\\nidentical to the classical result (5).To summarize: The story told by quantum mechanics\\nis dramatically diﬀerent from the classical one. Classi-\\ncally it is the light in the D 1beam that is responsible\\nfor giving the mirror the kick towards the inside of the\\ninterferometer. Indeed, it is only this beam that can give\\na momentum in this direction. The light in the inter-\\nferometer can either give no momentum (beam A), or a\\nmomentum towards the exterior (beam B). It was there-\\nfore tempting to assume that quantum mechanically it\\nis also the case that the photons in the D 1beam are\\nthose responsible for the eﬀect. What we found how-\\never is that the photons that end up in the D 1beam\\nhave overall no eﬀect whatsoever - the momentum they\\ngive when colliding with the mirror from the outside is\\nexactly compensated by the momentum they gave the\\nmirror while inside the interferometer, so the total mo-\\nmentum they give is strictly zero. In fact, according to\\nquantum mechanics, it is the photons that end up in the\\nD2beam that give the momentum kick. Astonishingly,\\nalthoughtheycollidewiththemirroronlyfromtheinside\\nof the interferometer, they do not push the mirror out-\\nwards; rather they somehow succeed to pull it in! This\\nis realized by a superposition of giving the mirror zero\\nmomentum and positive momentum - the superposition\\nresults in the mirror gaining negative momentum.\\nAs mentioned before, our analysis is not limited to in-\\nterpretational issues. It also serves as a guide for our\\nintuition. Suppose that, by a quantum ﬂuctuation, we\\nreceive more than the average number of photons at de-\\ntector D 1. The classical intuition will led us to expect\\nthat now the mirror will receive an even larger momen-\\ntum inwards. Our analysis above tells us diﬀerently -\\nsince the eﬀect is due to photons going towards D 2and\\nnow there are fewer of them, the inward momentum will\\nbe smaller.\\nAcknowledgments This work was supported in part\\nby the Binational Science Foundation Grant 32/08, the\\nIsrael Science Foundation Grant No. 1125/10, the Tem-\\npleton Foundation, ERC Advanced grant NLST and EU\\ngrant Qessence.\\n[1] R.

This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,16]. In all but a few cases [ 22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [ 15] and ConvS2S [ 8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1;:::;x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1;:::;z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1;:::;y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\n2', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\n3', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nquery with all keys, divide each bypdk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q;K;V ) = softmax(QKT\\npdk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pdk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q\\x01k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='MultiHead( Q;K;V ) = Concat(head 1;:::;head h)WO\\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\\ni;KWK\\ni;VWV\\ni)\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\\ni2Rdmodel\\x02dk,WK\\ni2Rdmodel\\x02dk,WV\\ni2Rdmodel\\x02dv\\nandWO2Rhdv\\x02dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel=h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n\\x0fIn \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n\\x0fThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n\\x0fSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \\x001) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0;xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights bypdmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2\\x01d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n\\x01d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k\\x01n\\x01d2)O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r\\x01n\\x01d)O(1) O(n=r)\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and ﬁxed [8].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos;2i)=sin(pos=100002i=d model)\\nPE(pos;2i+1)=cos(pos=100002i=d model)\\nwhereposis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\\x19to10000\\x012\\x19. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1;:::;x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1;:::;z n), withxi;zi2Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n=r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k\\x01n\\x01d+n\\x01d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] with\\x0c1= 0:9,\\x0c2= 0:98and\\x0f= 10\\x009. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d\\x000:5\\nmodel\\x01min(step_num\\x000:5;step _num\\x01warmup _steps\\x001:5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop= 0:1.\\n7', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [15] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [32] 39.2 1:0\\x011020\\nGNMT + RL [31] 24.6 39.92 2:3\\x0110191:4\\x011020\\nConvS2S [8] 25.16 40.46 9:6\\x0110181:5\\x011020\\nMoE [26] 26.03 40.56 2:0\\x0110191:2\\x011020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [32] 40.4 8:0\\x011020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [31] 26.30 41.16 1:8\\x0110201:1\\x011021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [8] 26.36 41.29 7:7\\x0110191:2\\x011021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3:3\\x011018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.0 2:3\\x011019\\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value \\x0fls= 0:1[30].

For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty \\x0b= 0:6[31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='References\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Artificial intelligence in human resources – an \\nintroduction\\nStefan Strohmeier\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an important field of computer science that is addition -\\nally related to different further scientific disciplines such as philosophy, mathematics, statis-\\ntics, anthropology, psychology, neurology, biology, or linguistics (e.g., Russell & Norvig, \\n2021). Starting in the 1950s, AI shows a long and volatile history of successes and setbacks \\n(e.g., Delipetrev et al., 2020). Based on ever increasing (“big”) data stocks and computing \\npower, in the 2010s particularly machine learning, an important field of AI, took an upswing \\nthat led to intriguing improvements in a lot of domains such as machine translation, robotic \\nvehicles, or game playing (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). In the wake of these successes, AI \\ninduced growing attention, discussion, and also application in numerous domains, among \\nthem the human resource (HR) domain. In the HR domain it is expected that AI will massively \\nexpand augmentation and automation towards complex tasks such as communication and \\ndecision making and even entire management (e.g., Strohmeier, 2020; Strohmeier & Piazza, \\n2015). Following discussions and developments in practice, research also started to consider \\nAI in HR. The current overall state of research, however, is that it is nascent and scattered over \\ndifferent disciplines, and is far from systematically accompanying and guiding practice. To \\ntrigger and support such research, the current handbook thus aims at providing a systematic \\nintroduction to research on AI in HR. To introduce readers to the handbook, the current chapter \\nelaborates on the basics of AI in HR and subsequently delineates the objectives, structure, and \\ncontributions of the handbook.\\nBASICS OF AI IN HR\\nAs AI in HR constitutes a multifaceted and complex phenomenon, it is frequently not well \\nunderstood (e.g., Long & Magerko, 2020). The following section thus briefly introduces the \\nbasics of the field, by elaborating on the definition , categorization , and history and state of \\nAI in HR.\\nDefinition of AI in HR\\nRegarding a definition of AI, there is a large set of suggestions uncovering different under-\\nstandings (see e.g. the review of definitions by Monett & Lewis, 2018, the discussion of \\ndefinitions by Wang, 2019, and the versatile reactions to this in Monett et al., 2020). Existing \\nAI definitions are often based on similarities between AI and natural intelligence (NI). That \\nis, AI is defined as a technology that is “similar” to NI, while there are, however, differences \\nin the ways in which NI and AI are seen as similar (Wang, 2019). Early definitions refer, for \\ninstance, to structural similarities of AI and NI (“AI is structured like the brain of a natural \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='2 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nintelligent being”) or behavioral similarities of NI and AI (“AI behaves like a natural intel -\\nligent being”). Since such similarities are narrow and restrictive, more frequently functional \\nsimilarities (“AI provides functions like a natural intelligent being”) are employed for defining \\nAI (Wang, 2019). Aiming at researching and exploiting the functions that AI provides to HR, \\na functional definition approach thus seems adequate and the following working definition can \\nbe suggested: AI designates the set of digital technologies that mimic certain functions of NI, \\nsuch as perceiving, learning, knowing, or reasoning, to augment or automate human tasks, \\nwhich conventionally require such functions of NI to be performed.\\nThis definition needs several clarifications: First, with the definition component of “mimic \\ncertain functions of NI” the above definition is premised on the idea that there is a similarity \\nbetween NI and AI. This similarity of providing intelligent functions, however, is restricted \\nand in need of concretization. A frequent metaphor for illustrating the restricted similarity \\nrefers to the comparison of natural flying with artificial flying (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). \\nTaking birds and helicopters as examples, both show the function of flying. However, both \\nrealize this function through very dissimilar procedures. A first clarification, thus, is that sim-\\nilarities of NI and AI refer to the results rather than to the procedure of gaining these results. \\nMoreover, as helicopters for instance are able to fly backwards while birds are not, the results \\nalso differ. In this sense, AI uses procedures dissimilar to NI ones to produce results that are \\nsimilar to NI results but are not identical. Second, with the definition component of “function s \\nof NI” the scope of the AI concept sensitively depends on the understanding of the “NI func-\\ntions” concept. A broad understanding that encompasses any cognitive activity as an NI func-\\ntion would imply that, for instance, “calculating” constitutes a function of NI. This, however, \\nwould in turn count spread-sheets, which augment and automate the human task of calculation, \\nas AI, even though spread-sheets conventionally are not seen as AI. AI literature, thus, uses \\na conventional set of functions of NI such as sensing, reasoning, learning, or knowing (e.g., \\nRussell & Norvig, 2021) to determine AI, rather than systematically determining the function \\nconcept and, based on this, determining AI. The definition is thus not fully selective in sepa-\\nrating technologies conventionally understood as AI from further technologies. Third, the defi-\\nnition component of “NI” includes human intelligence as a core category, yet goes beyond by \\nexplicitly allowing for further categories such as general biological intelligence (Wang, 2019). \\nFourth, with the definition component “set of digital technologies” AI should be understood as \\na set of different technologies, rather than as one homogeneous technology.\\nCategorization of AI in HR\\nRecent attempts to categorize AI (e.g., Corea, 2019; Golstein, 2020) uncover the complexity \\nand versatility of the field that evades any simple and neat internal and external delineation. \\nNevertheless, in order to create a basic understanding of the field, in the following the strength, \\nparadigm, convention, and function  of AI are employed as criteria to roughly categorize AI \\nin HR.\\nCategorization by strength\\nStrength designates the overarching level of intelligence expected from AI, while in a rough \\ncategorization narrow, general, and super AI can be distinguished (e.g., Bostrom, 2014; \\nRussell & Norvig, 2021; Searle, 1980). Narrow AI (also known as weak AI) aims at tackling \\na more or less defined, single human task. While narrow AI can even outperform humans in \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 3\\nthis specific task, it is not able to perform any other human task, even if more trivial. Narrow \\nAI is frequently associated with the position that AI can only act as if it would be intelligent, \\nthat is, thinks, has a mind, and so on (Searle, 1980; Bunge, 1956a and 1956b). General AI (also \\nknown as strong AI, artificial general intelligence [AGI], full AI, or human-level AI [HLAI]) \\naims at tackling any task that humans can perform based on NI. General AI is frequently \\nassociated with the position that AI actually is intelligent – that is, actually thinks, actually has \\na mind, and so on – therewith raising issues such as machine consciousness, self-awareness, \\nand intentionality, which on their part raise subsequent issues such as machine rights and \\nresponsibilities (Russell & Norvig, 2021; Searle, 1980). Super AI (also known as artificial \\nsuper intelligence ) aims at qualitatively and quantitatively outperforming humans in any task \\nand beyond, allowing the performance of tasks that cannot be completed by humans due to \\ntheir NI restrictions (e.g., Bostrom, 2014). Beyond the issues raised by general AI, super AI \\nraises further issues such as self-triggered exponential growth (“explosion”) of AI or machine \\ndominance over humans (e.g., Bostrom, 2014). At the moment, only narrow AI can be real -\\nized, and there is ongoing dispute as to whether general (let alone super) AI could be or even \\nshould be realized (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021; Bostrom, 2014; Wang, 2019).\\nBased on this, all current applications of AI in HR necessarily are narrow AI. (For this \\nreason, the above definition of AI shows an explicitly narrow understanding.) The current \\ndiscussion on AI in HR, however, ignores this at times and (at least implicitly) assumes the \\nexistence of non-narrow varieties of AI, for instance in the popular discussion of whether “AI \\nwill take over HR” (e.g., Hmoud & Laszlo, 2019; Lin et al., 2018).\\nCategorization by paradigm\\nA paradigm designates the basic approach that AI takes to achieve results, while in a rough \\ncategorization symbolic and connectionist AI can be distinguished (e.g., Russell & Norvig, \\n2021). Symbolic AI (also known as good old-fashioned AI [GOFAI]) is a paradigm within \\nwhich humans build a model of reality by using symbolic representations such as words or \\nphrases and AI employs or manipulates this symbolic model to achieve results. Since such \\nsymbolic models are conventionally built by humans, they are “hand-crafted” and usually \\neffortful. Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm in earlier phases of AI research, thus \\nexplaining the designation of “good old-fashioned AI” (Haugeland, 1985). Connectionist AI \\n(also known as sub-symbolic AI or non-symbolic AI) is a paradigm that uses representations of \\nreality such as pixels or structured data to let AI itself learn a model of reality by connecting \\nknown inputs and outputs.\\nBoth AI paradigms are discussed and applied in HR. Knowledge-based search and matching \\nengines in recruiting, which use a symbolic knowledge base (“ontology”) for improving search \\nand matching results, constitute an example of current symbolic AI in HR (e.g., Martinez-Gil \\net al., 2016). HR analytics applications that use artificial neural networks to predict future \\nemployee absenteeism constitute an example of current connectionist AI in HR (e.g., Ali Shah \\net al., 2020). While systematic empirical studies on the adoption of AI paradigms in HR are \\nmissing, there are clear indications that applications in HR follow the general trend and a clear \\nmajority of HR applications refer to connectionist AI (see section “History and state of AI in \\nHR”).\\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='4 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nCategorization by convention\\nConventions are historically emerged agreements on categorizing AI, as for instance man-\\nifested in AI textbooks, journals, conferences, and departments. The background for this \\ncategorization thus is historical rather than theoretical (Wang, 2019). Conventional AI fields \\nare rather distinct, are based on different foundations, and use different methods to solve \\ndifferent problems (Russell & Norvig, 2021; Wang, 2019). As a consequence, the different \\nfields do not necessarily collaborate on a regular basis. This fragmentation evidently detracts \\nfrom a unified discipline of AI (Wang, 2019). Moreover, as they have their own designations, \\nsuch as “computer vision” or “natural language processing”, these fields label themselves as \\n“AI” only if the public opinion on AI happens to be positive (Russell & Norvig, 2021), as is \\nthe case at the time of writing this chapter. Though there are conventions of categorizing AI, \\nit comes as no surprise that there is no complete consensus, and that existing categorizations \\nsomewhat differ. This brings about the question of which fields to consider. As this handbook \\naims at a comprehensive consideration of AI in HR, the following fields of AI that show actual \\nor potential relevance in HR are considered: First, this of course includes the well-established \\n“classic” AI fields of computer vision, knowledge representation , reasoning, machine learn-\\ning, robotics, and natural languages processing (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). Second, this \\nincludes three further fields of AI that show direct relevance for HR. A first additional field \\nrefers to evolutionary computing (e.g., Eiben & Smith, 2015). Occasionally, evolutionary \\ncomputing is understood as a sub-category of machine learning (e.g., by Sammut & Webb, \\n2017); as it however differs from machine learning in its basic approach, it is counted as an AI \\ncategory sui generis by this handbook. A second additional field refers to affective computing \\n(e.g., Picard, 2000 and 2015). A third additional field refers to robotic process automation \\n(e.g., Czarnecki & Fettke, 2021). By incorporating more and more AI functions, robotic \\nprocess automation currently just establishes itself as field of AI. While other categorizations \\nby convention are admittedly possible, these fields are seen as relevant and thus are briefly \\nintroduced in the following.\\nComputer vision constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the visual perception of \\nhumans (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). Computer vision learns patterns in existing digital \\nimages and videos as recorded by cameras and employs these patterns for sensing new digital \\nimages or videos. Core objectives refer to “seeing”, “understanding” what is seen, and sensing \\ncomplex visual information (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021).\\nKnowledge representation  constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the internal \\nmapping of facts by humans (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). Knowledge representation sys-\\ntematically ascertains intended knowledge and subsequently formally maps it in knowledge \\nbases using knowledge representation techniques such as ontologies. The core objective is \\nproviding knowledge bases for reasoning and for solving problems (e.g., Russell & Norvig, \\n2021).\\nReasoning constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the internal thought processes \\nof humans (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). Reasoning employs reasoners (also inference \\nengines), which infer logical consequences from a set of facts as for instance stored in a knowl-\\nedge base. Core objectives are providing new information and solving problems (e.g., Russell \\n& Norvig, 2021).\\nMachine learning constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the acquisition of new \\nknowledge by humans (Jordan & Mitchell, 2015). Machine learning employs existing data to \\n“learn” knowledge inherent in these data and map this knowledge in a model. The overarching \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 5\\nobjective is improving human and machine performance in a certain application domain based \\non the provided knowledge (Jordan & Mitchell, 2015).\\nRobotics  constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the physical manipulation of (parts \\nof) the world by humans (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021). Robotics employs physical robots \\nthat use sensors, such as cameras, radars, or lasers, to enable the perception of their environ-\\nment, and effectors, such as wheels, legs, or grippers, to assert the intended physical forces. \\nThe overarching objective is purposefully changing the physical environment (e.g., Russell & \\nNorvig, 2021).\\nRobotic process automation constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the perfor-\\nmance of operational work processes by humans (e.g., Czarnecki & Fettke, 2021). Robotic \\nprocess automation employs non-physical (i.e., software) robots that first “learn” and subse-\\nquently automate human process performance, thereby autonomously interacting with opera-\\ntional software, further robots, and humans. The core objective refers to automating (and thus \\naccelerating, improving, and cheapening) process execution (e.g., Czarnecki & Fettke, 2021).\\nEvolutionary computing constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking biological problem \\nsolving (and therewith general natural rather than specific human intelligence) for finding \\nan acceptably good solution within a large set of alternatives. It therefore aims at providing \\nheuristics for finding solutions for problems too complex for straightforward mathematical \\noptimization (e.g., Eiben & Smith, 2015).\\nNatural language processing constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the \\nlanguage-based communication of humans. Natural language processing employs speech \\nrecognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. Core objectives \\nrefer to a direct communication between machines and humans, and beyond to autonomous \\nlearning of machines from extensively available written human knowledge (Russell & Norvig, \\n2021).\\nAffective computing (also emotion AI) constitutes a field of AI that aims at mimicking the \\nhuman perception and expression of emotion (Picard, 2000 and 2015). Affective computing \\nthus recognizes, reacts to, and simulates human affects such as fear, anger, joy, surprise, or \\ndisgust. Core objectives refer to improving the interaction of machines and emotional humans, \\nand thus the respective outcomes of the machine–human interaction (Picard, 2000 and 2015).\\nIt is important to note that the above fields are not neatly separated, autonomous areas of AI \\nresearch and application, but quite contrarily show complex overlaps and interactions. To give \\na rough impression of this, Figure 1.1 shows core supporting (an AI field supports another AI \\nfield by improving and/or expanding it) and core enabling  (an AI field enables another AI field \\nby transferring methods to a new application domain) relationships.\\nThis uncovers the prominent position of machine learning that enables or at least supports \\ndiverse other fields (e.g., Jordan & Mitchell, 2015). Machine learning, for instance, enables \\naffective computing by allowing for learning models of human affect based on voice, gesture, \\nand other data, that can be used for automated affect recognition. Machine learning becomes \\neven more prominent if evolutionary computing is categorized as a sub-field of machine learn -\\ning (as e.g. by Sammut & Webb, 2017). Further supporting relationships refer for instance to \\nreasoning and knowledge representation, since the former regularly employs knowledge bases \\nof the latter as input. Moreover, relationships further uncover robotics process automation and \\nrobotics as “composite” AI fields that are based on the support of several other AI fields. As \\na consequence of such overlaps and interactions, existing applications of AI in HR are not \\nnecessarily unambiguously assignable to one field of AI. For instance, HR sentiment analysis \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Figure 1.1 Intertwining of conventional AI categories6 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\n(e.g., Costa & Veloso, 2015) can be and actually is assigned to machine learning, natural lan-\\nguage processing, or affective computing. Beyond such categorization ambiguities, there are \\nhowever true composite applications of AI in HR that rely on the functionalities of multiple \\nAI fields. For instance, physical robots for conducting job interviews (e.g., Inoue et al., 2020) \\nevidently rely on robotics and natural language processing.\\nAll the above AI fields show basic application potentials in HR. Even though systematic \\nempirical insights on the adoption of AI in HR are missing, distinct differences regarding the \\napplication of different AI fields are to be expected. Machine learning, for instance, is by now \\nalready more broadly applied in HR, while robotics, for instance, is just beginning to be used \\n(see section “History and state of AI in HR”).\\nCategorization by function\\nFunctions designate the categories of NI that AI intends to mimic. In the following, a prag-\\nmatic categorization based on different existing categorizations in NI literature (see e.g. the \\noverview on NI theories by Kaufman et al., 2013) and AI literature (see e.g. the categorization \\nby Russell & Norvig, 2021) is employed. As core NI functions mimicked by AI, cognitive  (i.e., \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 7\\nperceiving , reasoning, knowing, and learning), practical  (i.e., deciding , acting , and solving), \\nand social (i.e., communicating  and empathizing) intelligence  functions  can be distinguished.\\nPerceiving  refers to the sensing and interpretation of external signals to represent and \\nunderstand one’s environment. Reasoning refers to the internal act of logical thinking to gain \\nknowledge. Knowing refers to the internal representation and understanding of issues, such as \\nfacts (propositional knowledge) or skills (procedural knowledge). Learning refers to acquiring \\nsuch new knowledge. As perceiving, reasoning, knowing, and learning are interrelated and \\nrefer to the acquisition, production, and representation of knowledge they can be categorized \\nas core cognitive functions of NI (e.g., Brody, 2004).\\nDeciding  refers to choosing between different alternative actions under uncertainty. Acting  \\nrefers to performing a purposeful activity, be it by active doing or passive tolerating. Solving  \\nrefers to finding the best – or at least an acceptably good – solution among a large set of \\ndifferent alternatives. As deciding, acting, and solving constitute three interrelated functions \\nto realize humans’ ideas and objectives to assert themselves, survive, and progress in their \\nenvironment, they can be categorized as core practical functions of NI (e.g., Sternberg, 1985).\\nCommunicating refers to transferring information and meaning in a verbal or non-verbal \\nmanner. Empathizing refers to recognizing, understanding, and reacting to the emotional states \\nof humans. As communicating and empathizing constitute two important functions of starting, \\nmaintaining, and improving social relations they can be categorized as core social functions of \\nNI (e.g., Kaufman et al., 2013).\\nThe above functions can be used to categorize applications of AI in HR. However, because \\nof the interrelations of the different functions, AI applications regularly mimic several \\ninteracting functions, rather than one isolated function. For instance, as the result of learning \\nis knowing, an AI application that mimics learning necessarily also implies that it mimics \\nknowing. Given the mentioned lack of empirical studies, insights on which functions are rele -\\nvant in HR applications are missing, yet a broader relevance can be assumed based on existing \\napplication examples. For instance, expert systems mimic human knowing and reasoning \\n(e.g., Lawler & Elliot, 1996), machine learning mimics human learning, knowing, deciding, \\nand acting (e.g., Ali Shah et al., 2020), evolutionary scheduling mimics human solving and \\ndeciding (e.g., Apornak et al., 2021), robotic process automation mimics human learning, \\ndeciding, and acting (e.g., Papageorgiou, 2018), and conversational agents mimic human \\ncommunicating (e.g., Sheth, 2018).\\nIntegrated categorization\\nIn order to provide an integrated overview, in the following the above criteria are employed \\ntogether to allow for an integrated categorization – with the exception of the criterion of \\nstrength, which has only one existing category (“narrow AI”) (see Figure 1.2).\\nThis integrated categorization initially classifies the conventional AI fields according to the \\nprimary paradigm they mainly follow. With knowledge representation and reasoning, only two \\nfields refer primarily to symbolic AI, while all other fields refer primarily to connectionist AI. \\nMoreover, the integrated categorization uncovers the primary and secondary functions of NI \\nthat AI intends to mimic. The focus of the different fields is shown by their primary function. \\nHowever, given the interrelations of NI functions, primary functions are regularly accompa -\\nnied by secondary functions. For instance, machine learning shows the primary function of \\n“learning” new knowledge from existing data. As the resulting knowledge however is mapped \\nin a model, a first secondary function is “knowing”. Moreover, as machine learning can learn \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='Figure 1.2 Integrated categorization of AI8 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nhow to decide based on data on past decisions or to solve a problem based on past solutions, \\n“deciding” and “solving” constitute further secondary functions. Finally, if data contain solu-\\ntions to problems or tasks, machine learning can learn these solutions, which if automated can \\nbe seen as autonomous “acting” as a further secondary function. In this way, different fields \\nshow different functional foci, which in sum add up to a broad set of relevant NI functions that \\ncan be mimicked by AI.\\nHistory and State of AI in HR\\nHistory\\nGeneral AI shows a longer history that is characterized by cyclical ups and downs (e.g., \\nHaenlein & Kaplan, 2019; Delipetrev et al., 2020). With the seasonal metaphors of “AI \\nsummer” (phase of positive expectations, attention, and investment) and “AI winter” (phase \\nof negative expectations, disregard, and disinvestments), AI even has its own terminology to \\nname the ups and downs of public opinion (e.g., Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019).\\nThe beginning of AI is regularly dated back to the 1950s. In the subsequent foundation \\nphase the basics of AI were researched and developed (e.g., Delipetrev et al., 2020). While \\nthere was a certain focus on symbolic AI in this phase, pioneering work in connectionist AI, \\nparticularly artificial neural networks, was also done. This led to a first AI summer.

By and by the – at times bold – expectations and promises of the foundation \\nphase turned out to be exaggeratedly optimistic, thus bringing about the first AI winter in the \\n1970s (e.g., Delipetrev et al., 2020; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019).\\nIn the 1980s, a shift towards expert systems (also knowledge-based systems) induced \\na symbolic phase and led to a second upswing of AI (e.g., Delipetrev et al., 2020; Haenlein \\n& Kaplan, 2019). Based on knowledge representation and reasoning, expert systems aim at \\nmapping the expertise of a domain and use it for providing information and decision support \\nto non-domain experts. Although with a certain delay, HR also participated in this second \\nsummer of AI, as diverse attempts to develop “HR expert systems” show (e.g., Chu, 1990; \\nExtejt & Lynn, 1988; Hannon et al., 1990). Again, the high expectations of this second phase \\nwere finally not met. Being symbolic and thus “hand-crafted” AI, expert systems require high \\ndevelopment effort, are dependent on experts and modellable expertise, and frequently have \\nto be developed company-specific (e.g., Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). In the wake of these dif-\\nficulties, expert systems were not broadly adopted in HR and other domains. A new AI winter \\nemerged.\\nA new upswing, the third by now, started with the dawning of the 2010s. Constantly \\ngrowing (“big”) data stocks and constantly increasing computing power enabled a massive \\nshift to connectionist AI, especially machine learning (e.g., Delipetrev et al., 2020). This \\nconnectionist phase brought about intriguing improvements in a broad range of domains, such \\nas machine translation, robotic vehicles, or game playing (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2021), and \\nled to a new AI summer. Like many other domains, HR is participating in this AI upturn, as \\nmanifested in broad discussions on and expectations of AI in HR (e.g., Ernst & Young, 2018; \\nIBM, 2018; Oracle, 2019; PWC, 2017), in new AI-enabled HR conceptions such as “big HR \\ndata” (e.g., Garcia-Arroyo & Osca, 2021) or “HR analytics” (e.g., Madsen & Slåtten, 2017), \\nand, of course, in practical applications of AI in HR such as natural language processing in \\nrecruiting or machine learning in selection.\\nState\\nTo roughly delineate the current state of AI in HR, the paradigms, categories, and sub-categories \\nof AI in HR are grouped into a life-cycle model of digital technologies (Gartner, 2021). The \\nmodel assumes that digital technologies pass through ideal-typical phases over time, which \\nare characterized by clearly different levels of expectations of the respective technology. \\nThese start with a trigger phase (a technological breakthrough triggers the respective technol -\\nogy), which is followed by a peak phase (overenthusiasm and unrealistic high expectations \\nreinforced by media), a disillusionment phase (overexaggerated expectations cannot be met, \\nexpectations plunge again reinforced by media), and finally two recovery phases (ongoing \\nelaboration of the technology allows for a more realistic assessment, improvement, and finally \\na productive application) (Gartner, 2021). Even though the model is not without critique (e.g., \\nDedehayir & Steinert, 2016), its application allows for deriving some interesting insights on \\nthe current state of AI in HR. As systematic empirical studies of expectations on and adoption \\nof different paradigms, categories, and sub-categories of AI in HR are lacking, the grouping \\nwas realized based on expert estimates by the respective authors of this handbook (see Figure \\n1.3).\\nFirst, as already indicated by the above definition and categorization, AI is not a homogene -\\nous block of technology, but decays into different paradigms, categories, and sub-categories. \\nThese imply different application potentials, different use cases, and different consequences \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Figure 1.3 Current state of AI in HR10 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nin HR. A first insight thus refers to the heterogeneity of AI in HR. Consequently, the respec-\\ntive (sub-)categories should be carefully distinguished, rather than lumped together as “AI”, \\ntherewith employing an attention-grabbing but heterogeneous and, thus, ambiguous concept.\\nSecond, on the paradigmatic level the model clearly predicts and maps the summer and winter \\nphases of AI. The last AI winter referred to symbolic AI and its passage through the phase of \\ndisillusionment. Even though not all (sub-)categories of symbolic AI could be transferred into \\nproductive applications, there are nevertheless examples where this has been achieved, such as \\nknowledge- (ontology-) based search and matching engines in recruiting (e.g., Martinez-Gil et \\nal., 2016). This is evidence for the model assumption that continued development can lead to \\nproductive application of a technology after a disillusionment phase. The current AI summer \\nand the high expectations of AI, contrarily are clearly driven by the connectionist paradigm \\nand its versatile (sub-)categories. A second insight, thus, is that connectionist AI constitutes \\nthe dominant paradigm of current interest and expectation, while, however, applications of \\nsymbolic AI in HR also exist.\\nThird, the current high expectations do not apply equally to all categories of connectionist \\nAI but refer mainly to three categories. Machine learning receives the most attention. Based \\non the current intensive discussion on “HR analytics” and related concepts, diverse forms \\nof machine learning based analytics incur a lot of attention (e.g., Giermindl et al., 2021; \\nLengnick-Hall et al., 2018). Moreover, natural language processing, in particular in the form \\nof conversational agents (“chat bots”), also gets a lot of attention in professional discussion. \\nWith a certain lag, and currently just emerging, robotic process automation is also attracting \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 11\\na growing amount of attention. A third insight, thus, is that the current high expectations of AI \\nmostly refer to three connectionist AI categories.\\nFourth, in HR, AI as a whole still constitutes an emerging rather than a mature technology. \\nHowever, on a sub-category level there are AI applications that have already been adopted \\nproductively. This refers to sub-categories such as parsing of CVs in recruiting, knowledge- \\n(ontology-) based search and matching in recruiting, or evolutionary computing in staff ros-\\ntering. Although these applications are being more frequently adopted, they are not the focus \\nof current attention and therefore constitute “stealth” applications of AI in HR, being mostly \\n“beneath the radar” of current discussions. A fourth insight, thus, is that AI already has some \\nestablished applications in HR and, thus, is more than just an academic mental exercise.\\nFifth, the current discussion additionally largely overlooks potentially relevant AI catego -\\nries that might become productively applicable in the future. This first refers to robotics, which \\nhas broad potentials for HR applications, be it as hybrid robots that beyond their primary \\nmanufacturing or service tasks (e.g., Steil & Maier, 2017) also perform secondary HR tasks \\nsuch as performance appraisal, or as proprietary physical robots exclusively built for HR \\npurposes such as job interviews (e.g., Inoue et al., 2020; Nørskov & Ulhøi, 2020). Moreover, \\nas HR deals with humans and, thus, with human emotions, affective computing also promises \\nobvious and broad potentials – for instance for identifying and managing employee stress (e.g., \\nRichardson, 2020) or improving the performance of employees by considering and improv-\\ning their emotional states (e.g., Lee, 2019). Perhaps even more mid-term opportunities (yet \\nalso threats) in HR will be offered by computer vision, which could be used not only for the \\nprediction and prevention of work accidents (e.g., Liu et al., 2019) but also for the systematic \\nsurveillance of employee performance (e.g., Lebedeva et al., 2019) and even general employee \\nbehavior (e.g., Alom et al., 2014). A fifth insight, thus, is that there are more relevant catego -\\nries of AI in HR than recognized and considered in the current discussion.\\nSixth, as demonstrated by HR expert systems, there are also setbacks in applying AI in HR. \\nIn the wake of the second AI summer (“symbolic phase”), expert systems aimed at providing \\ninformation and decision support in domains with rather qualitative procedures and expertise. \\nHR, thus, initially seemed an ideal candidate for expert systems, and there were large expec -\\ntations and promises. Consequently, there were practical attempts to develop and apply HR \\nexpert systems (e.g., Hannon et al., 1990). Only the practical attempt of developing HR expert \\nsystems uncovered the huge effort of “hand-crafting” knowledge bases and further problems \\nsuch as the limited availability of experts and knowledge. While there still are current schol-\\narly attempts to capitalize on the expert systems concept in HR (e.g., Angela et al., 2020; \\nBohlouli et al., 2017), expert systems have so far not been able to get rid of the negative image \\nacquired in the second AI winter, and they currently show low expectations and adoption in \\nHR. A sixth insight therefore is that applications of AI in HR have, of course, no guarantee of \\nsuccess and require the willingness to take certain risks.\\nSeventh, the model predicts that the current “hype” phase of connectionist AI in HR will \\nbe followed by a disillusionment phase, in which expectations literally plunge. As there are \\nevident indicators of overenthusiasm in the current AI discussion, it is important to expect and \\naccept coming disillusionment as a “normal” phase that can be followed by recovery and the \\nproductive application of AI (Gartner, 2021). Since it produces and increases overenthusiasm, \\nthe ongoing active “hyping” of AI in HR – as practiced by certain authors, consultants, and \\nvendors at the time of writing this chapter – is clearly counter-productive. A seventh insight, \\nthus, is that the current enthusiasm will expectedly be followed by disillusionment. The latter \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='12 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nneeds to be accepted and overcome through ongoing efforts to productively apply AI in \\nHR, rather than precipitately giving up on it and therewith “throwing out the baby with the \\nbathwater”.\\nHANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON AI IN HR\\nWith the above delineation of AI in HR, an intriguing, relevant, and manifold field of research \\nappears in outline. The current section thus briefly and roughly provides an overview of \\ncurrent research on AI in HR to derive the objectives of this handbook and subsequently intro-\\nduces its structure and chapters.\\nExisting Research and Objectives of the Handbook\\nSo far, there is no established community of researchers (let alone established conferences or \\njournals) that is specialized on AI (or one of its fields) in HR. Existing research is scattered \\nover different disciplines and numerous outlets. While recently there have been some serious \\nreviews of this research, these are restricted to specific disciplinary perspectives and bounda-\\nries, as well as to specific aspects of AI in HR. Existing reviews refer to:\\n ●generic AI in general HR (Vrontis et al., 2021),\\n ●generic “algorithms” in general HR (Cheng & Hackett, 2021),\\n ●machine learning in\\n ●general HR (Berhil et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2021; Strohmeier & Piazza, 2013),\\n ●personality traits prediction (Azucar et al., 2018),\\n ●learning (e.g., Du et al., 2020; Romero & Ventura, 2020, among others),\\n ●recruiting (Siting et al., 2012; Freire & Castro, 2021), and\\n ●turnover prediction (Ekawati, 2019; Zhao et al., 2018),\\n ●affective computing in learning (Yadegaridehkordi et al., 2019),\\n ●computer vision in employee safety (Liu et al., 2019),\\n ●fairness of AI in\\n ●general HR (Robert et al., 2020) and in\\n ●recruiting and development (Köchling & Wehner, 2020).\\nGaining an overview of current research on AI in HR, thus, is complex and cumbersome. \\nScanning existing research nevertheless allows some initial insights on its state and allows \\nderiving objectives for the current handbook.\\nFirst, existing research appears to be multi-topical  in the sense that a broad range of topical \\nissues are covered. Besides the technical issues of developing AI artifacts for HR (e.g., Pessach \\net al., 2020) and the managerial issues of applying AI artifacts in HR (e.g., Black & van Esch, \\n2020), diverse further topical areas such as the psychological (Hmoud & Várallyai, 2020), \\nethical (e.g., Loi, 2020), and legal (e.g., Barocas & Selbst, 2016) issues of applying AI in HR \\nare addressed. Such multi-topical research is mandatory: While particularly the managerial \\nissues of applying AI constitute a core domain aspect, it is clear that, first, application issues \\nare dependent on the preceding technical issues of developing appropriate AI artifacts and, \\nsecond, both development and application issues are inseparably superimposed by ethical, \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 13\\nlegal, and psychological issues, among others. The current handbook thus aims at an integrated \\nconsideration of the relevant issues of AI in HR.\\nSecond, and related to the above, existing research appears to be multi-disciplinary  in \\nthe sense that diverse disciplines participate. Relevant contributions stem for instance from \\ncomputer science (e.g., Fernández-Martínez & Fernández, 2020), information systems (e.g., \\nOchmann et al., 2020), law (e.g., Barocas & Selbst, 2016), economics (e.g., Chalfin et al., \\n2016), ethics (e.g., Loi, 2020), industrial and organizational psychology (e.g., Langer et \\nal., 2019), and human resource management (e.g., Charlwood, 2021), while the last – even \\nthough being the core domain discipline – seems not to lead the field. This research is \\nmulti- yet not interdisciplinary, as the different disciplines involved take little or no notice \\nof each other, and do not regularly cooperate. This is particularly true for the two core cat -\\negories of methodical-technical disciplines, which deal with the development of AI in HR, \\nand managerial-behavioral disciplines, which deal with the subsequent application of AI in \\nHR. While at first glance such a disciplinary division of labor seems obvious and promising, \\nexisting research shows that it is not. Methodical-technical disciplines often lack domain \\nexpertise. This yields AI artifacts that just do not fit domain opportunities and requirements \\n(e.g., Strohmeier & Piazza, 2013). Vice versa, managerial-behavioral disciplines often lack \\ntechnical expertise. This yields – at times blatant – misconceptions of AI, leading to both \\nexaggerated hopes and promises and exaggerated concerns and caveats regarding AI in HR. \\nTo improve this situation, participating disciplines must close their respective gaps in exper-\\ntise and/or cooperate with other relevant disciplines on an interdisciplinary basis (e.g., König \\net al., 2020). The current handbook thus aims at interdisciplinary research with the relevant \\ndisciplines considering and learning from each other.\\nThird, existing research appears to be multi-functional in the sense that it covers diverse HR \\nfunctions. Relevant contributions refer for instance to recruiting (e.g., Johnson et al., 2021), \\nselection (e.g., Liem et al., 2018), scheduling (e.g., Apornak et al., 2021), compensation and \\nbenefits (e.g., Petruzzellis et al., 2006), learning and development (e.g., Maity, 2019), per-\\nformance management (e.g., Ahmed et al., 2013), or HR administration (e.g., Chichester & \\nGiffen, 2019). However, following a general pattern of (applying and then) researching new \\ndigital technologies in HR (Strohmeier, 2007), recruiting and selection once again appear to \\nconstitute the pioneer and focus functions of current research. However, aiming at research \\nthat comprehensively and systematically maps the application domain of HR, future research \\nshould not only care for HR (sub-)functions that already show certain AI applications, but also \\nand in particular for opening up HR (sub-)functions that so far do not show AI applications. \\nThe current handbook thus explicitly aims at covering all the (sub-)functions of HR.\\nFourth, existing research appears to be multi-technical  in the sense that it covers all conven-\\ntional AI fields. Relevant contributions refer to reasoning (e.g., Kumar et al., 2014), knowl-\\nedge representation (e.g., Martinez-Gil et al., 2016), machine learning (e.g., Ali Shah et al., \\n2020), evolutionary computing (e.g., Apornak et al., 2021), robotics (e.g., Inoue et al., 2020), \\nrobotic process automation (e.g., Papageorgiou, 2018), natural language processing (e.g., \\nSheikh et al., 2019), and affective computing (e.g., Lee, 2019) in HR. However, there appear \\nto be striking differences regarding the intensity and frequency of research in these fields. \\nA massive core focus refers to machine learning – thereby not seldom even equating  machine \\nlearning with overall AI (e.g., Tambe et al., 2019). In comparison, research in other AI fields, \\nsuch as robotics, computer vision, or reasoning, falls significantly behind. As research on \\ndigital technologies generally tends to follow trends in practice (e.g., O’Leary, 2008), current \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='14 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nresearch on AI in HR echoes the current attention patterns of practice. However, as AI in HR \\nis heterogeneous, and as diverse AI fields either show future application potentials or even \\ncurrent applications in HR, the current handbook explicitly aims at a systematic consideration \\nof all AI fields in HR – whether or not they are currently “en vogue”. Because connectionist \\nAI in HR may be facing a phase of disillusionment and, beyond, connectionist AI as a whole \\nmay be facing a new “winter” (e.g., Floridi, 2020), it is necessary that research does not follow \\nthe volatile ups and downs of public opinion, but instead conducts constant and sober work on \\nwhat AI can or cannot really do in HR.\\nStructure and Contributions of the Handbook\\nStructure\\nThe current handbook consists of four parts:\\nPart I: Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources\\nPart I.1: Applications of Machine Learning in Human Resources\\nPart I.2: Further Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources\\nPart II: Consequences of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources\\nPart III: Normative Issues of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources\\nPart IV: Research Issues of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources.\\nPart I deals with actual and potential applications of AI in HR. To this end, the above con-\\nventional categorization of AI fields is employed for structuring the different chapters. Doing \\njustice to the distinct importance of machine learning (also) in HR, Part II is divided into \\ntwo sub-parts. A first sub-part (Part I.1) deals with applications of machine learning in HR \\n(Chapters 2–8), while chapters are oriented towards employing machine learning on core \\nHR data types and in core HR functions. A second sub-part (Part I.2) maps further relevant AI \\nfields ranging from HR knowledge representation and reasoning to HR affective computing \\n(Chapters 9–13). This allows mastering the heterogeneity and scope of AI in HR and enables \\nreaders to selectively read chapters of individual interest, or else gain a comprehensive over-\\nview on AI in HR by working step by step through the different chapters. Part II deals with \\nthe consequences of AI in HR. As AI is seen as a trigger for the digital transformation of HR, \\na chapter elaborates on the direct transformations of HR to be expected from applying AI in \\nHR and the indirect transformations of HR to be expected from applying AI for augmenting \\nand substituting employees in their work (Chapter 14). Part III deals with normative issues of \\nAI in HR. As ethical, social, and legal issues superimpose the development and the application \\nof AI, four chapters deal with the explainability, fairness, accountability, and legitimacy of \\nAI in HR (Chapters 15–18). Part IV deals with research issues of AI in HR. As this volume \\nis research oriented, this part refers both to researching AI in HR and to employing AI for \\nresearch in HR (Chapters 19 and 20).\\nGiven the early state and manifoldness of research on AI in HR, this structure provides \\ninterested researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the field and, \\nbeyond, provides interested researchers with multiple starting points for their own work, in the \\nhope that these will be taken up in the future.\\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 15\\nContributions\\nTo provide a general orientation, the following section briefly introduces the chapters of the \\nhandbook.\\nChapter 2 “HR machine learning – an introduction” written  by me (Stefan Strohmeier) \\ndelineates the basics of machine learning by providing a definition and elaborating on the \\nprocess, algorithms, and data of HR machine learning, as well as on its potentials and chal -\\nlenges. Based on this, the chapter examines research on HR machine learning and derives \\nimplications. In doing so, the chapter aims to act as an introduction to Part I.1 and lay the \\nfoundations for the following chapters on machine learning on different HR data types and in \\ndifferent HR functions.\\nChapter 3 “HR machine learning on text data” written by Felix Gross deals with machine \\nlearning on the specific data category of unstructured HR texts. The chapter delineates basic \\nmachine learning technologies for text data and discusses their application possibilities in HR. \\nBased on this, an overview on current research is given and an outlook for future research \\noptions and directions based on existing text data potentials is given. As the vast majority \\nof existing data are unstructured and as comprehensive text data exist in HR, this constitutes \\na first important extension and specialization of HR machine learning.\\nChapter 4 “HR machine learning on audio and video data” written by Carmen \\nFernández-Martinez and Alberto Fernández deals with machine learning on the specific \\ndata categories of unstructured audio and video data. The chapter delineates technologies for \\nvideo, audio, and multimodal processing. Moreover, common HR use cases are outlined and \\nopen research issues and challenges are discussed. As audio and video data are increasingly \\navailable and employed, this constitutes a second important extension and specialization of \\nHR machine learning. Since machine learning on video data largely overlaps with “computer \\nvision” the chapter also addresses the latter AI field.\\nChapter 5 “HR machine learning on social media data” written by Jake T. Harrison and \\nChristopher J. Hartwell deals with machine learning on the specific data category of social \\nmedia data. The chapter discusses the diverse data sources offered by different social media \\ncategories and uncovers how machine learning can be applied to capitalize on these data in dif-\\nferent areas of HR, such as predicting personality. Based on this, core research directions are \\nderived. As social media is widely adopted and is comprised of diverse data that are potentially \\nvaluable for HR, this constitutes a third important extension of machine learning.\\nChapter 6 “HR machine learning in recruiting ” written by Sven Laumer, Christian Maier, \\nand Tim Weitzel deals with the opportunities for utilizing machine learning in recruiting, \\nespecially to automate the finding and evaluation of candidates. Following an introduction on \\nmachine learning and recruiting, the chapter offers a systematic literature review and devel -\\nops a HR recruiting machine learning model. Based on the insights provided, various future \\nresearch opportunities are put forward that would improve the usage of machine learning in \\nrecruiting, such as broadening the perspective of fit, using common recruiting data sets, and \\navoiding discrimination.\\nChapter 7 “Machine learning in HR staffing ” written by Florian J. Meier and Sven Laumer \\ndeals with using machine learning for predicting developments relevant to staffing – in par-\\nticular for predicting future net employee requirements, reserve employee requirements, future \\nhires, and future attrition of employees. After introducing the staffing function conceptually, \\nthe chapter systematically reviews existing research contributions regarding their orientation, \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='16 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nobjectives, data basis and algorithms employed, achievements, and challenges. Based on this, \\nthe consequences for practice and research are discussed.\\nChapter 8 “Machine learning in personnel selection ” written by Cornelius J. König and \\nMarkus Langer introduces machine learning in the field of selection – therewith tackling \\na current core HR application of machine learning. After initially introducing the approaches \\nto using machine learning for selection purposes, the chapter reviews existing empirical \\nresearch on the potentials and the challenges. Based on this, the chapter provides suggestions \\nfor future research, in particular research that will provide evidence for the validity of machine \\nlearning approaches to selection, explore the human–AI interface, and examine the reactions \\nof users, applicants, and other stakeholders.\\nChapter 9 “HR knowledge representation and reasoning” written by Jorge Martinez-Gil \\ndeals with current applications of symbolic AI in HR, thereby treating the interrelated AI \\nfields of knowledge representation and reasoning together. The chapter uncovers how current \\nknowledge bases and reasoners are employed in HR, with a particular focus on searching for \\ncandidates and matching them to positions in the process of recruitment. Besides introducing \\nthe technical realizations and applications, the chapter elaborates on future tasks such as auto-\\nmating the building of knowledge bases and using them beyond recruiting, for instance in HR \\ndevelopment.\\nChapter 10 “HR robotic process automation” written by Peter Fettke and me (Stefan \\nStrohmeier) deals with the application of software robots to further automate the operation \\nof already implemented digital applications in HR and therewith closing existing automation \\ngaps. To this end, the problems that robotic process automation address and the solutions that \\nit offers are described. Based on this application, potentials and challenges of robotic process \\nautomation in HR are derived along with the state of current research and implications for \\nfuture research on the topic.\\nChapter 11 “HR evolutionary computing” written by Lena Wolbeck and Charlotte Köhler \\ndeals with the application of algorithms inspired by biological evolution for solving HR prob-\\nlems that are too complex for straightforward optimization. To this end, the chapter gives an \\noverview on the family of evolutionary algorithms. Based on this, various applications of evo-\\nlutionary algorithms for solving HR problems, in particular in scheduling and re-scheduling \\nemployees, are highlighted. Finally, current and future developments in evolutionary comput -\\ning within HR are reviewed.\\nChapter 12 “HR natural language processing – conceptual overview and state of the art on \\nconversational agents in human resources management” written by Sven Laumer and Stefan \\nMorana deals with natural language processing, in particular conversational agents, as applied \\nin HR. The chapter first introduces the technology of conversational agents. Subsequently, \\na conceptual overview on the application possibilities of conversational agents in HRM is \\nelaborated. Based on this conceptualization, the chapter reviews relevant research contribu -\\ntions and derives perspectives for future applications and future research on natural language \\nprocessing and conversational agents in HR.\\nChapter 13 “HR affective computing” written by William J. Becker, Sarah E. Tuskey, and \\nConstant D. Beugré deals with the recognition, stimulation, and expression of human emotion \\nby AI. It elaborates how these functions can be applied to improve and transform HR. Based \\non an introduction to the current state and likely future of affective computing, the chapter \\nexplores several application areas of affective computing in HR, among others in personnel \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 15}), Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in human resources – an introduction 17\\nselection and performance management, and derives avenues for future research on affective \\ncomputing in HR.\\nChapter 14 “Consequences of artificial intelligence in human resource management” \\nwritten by Maarten Renkema deals with the desired and undesired consequences of applying \\nAI in HR. To this end, it develops a framework that offers a categorization of the effects of \\nAI in HR and of the research on these effects. This allows for discussing the effects of AI and \\nhighlighting exemplary research. The chapter thus offers insights into (research on) how HRM \\ncan be transformed by achieving desirable consequences, while avoiding undesirable ones, \\nwhen applying AI in HRM.\\nChapter 15 “Explainability of artificial intelligence in human resources” written by \\nMarkus Langer and Cornelius König deals with the problem of the opacity of AI in HR \\nboth for humans applying AI in HR and for humans affected by it. The chapter introduces, \\ndiscusses, and further develops the concept of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (“XAI”) as \\na means of overcoming the opacity of AI in HR. Based on this, suggestions for future research \\non XAI in HR are provided. As opacity and incomprehensibility undermine acceptance, and \\nthus the adoption and success of AI in HR, XAI constitutes a crucial requirement of future \\napplications.\\nChapter 16 “Fairness of artificial intelligence in human resources – held to a higher stand-\\nard?” written by Sandra L. Fisher and Garret N. Howardson deals with the problem of fairness \\nof AI in HR decision making. While the biases of human HR decision makers are well known \\n(and frequently more or less accepted), public opinion is highly sensitive regarding potential \\ndiscrimination or errors in AI-based decisions. The chapter thus reviews different perspectives \\non the fairness of AI in HR decision making, discusses differences in judging the fairness \\nof humans and machines, and derives implications for research and practice to contribute to \\na fairer AI in HR in the future.\\nChapter 17 “Accountability of artificial intelligence in human resources” written by \\nKatharina A. Zweig and Franziska Raudonat deals with the problem of the attributability of \\nAI results in HR. If machines augment or even automate human tasks, in particular decisions, \\npositive as well as negative consequences emerge, leading to the question of who is account -\\nable for them. The chapter thus reviews different approaches to conceptualize accountability \\nof AI in HR, and employs the “long chain of responsibilities” and the “five role model” to \\ndiscuss responsibilities and uncover the complex accountability structures of developing and \\napplying AI in HR.\\nChapter 18 “Legitimacy of artificial intelligence in human resources – the legal frame-\\nwork for using artificial intelligence in human resource management” written by Kai von \\nLewinski and Raphael de Barros Fritz deals with the legal regulations of AI in HR. Given \\nthe large variety and diversity of relevant regulations worldwide, the chapter employs \\na three-times-three matrix to structure the field: on one axis, labor law, data protection law, \\nand anti-discrimination law, on the other axis, the technological level, the implementation \\nlevel, and the application level. This allows the systematic discussion of regulations based on \\nconcrete examples of different national regulations. In doing so the chapter offers a structured \\noverview on central legal regulations.\\nChapter 19 “Design considerations for conducting artificial intelligence research in \\nhuman resource management” written by Richard D. Johnson and Dianna L. Stone deals \\nwith approaches to researching AI in HR and provides guidance to researchers regarding their \\nchoice of an adequate research design. To this end, quantitative non-experimental design, \\nStefan Strohmeier - 9781839107535\\nDownloaded from PubFactory at 11/10/2022 03:28:52PM\\nvia free access\\n', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/[9781839107528 - Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management] Chapter 1_ Artificial intelligence in human resources - an introduction.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='18 Handbook of research on artificial intelligence in human resource management\\nqualitative non-experimental design, experiments, and quasi-experiments are introduced and \\nevaluated regarding their strengths and weaknesses for research on AI in HR based on illus-\\ntrative current examples. The chapter thereby offers support for choosing adequate research \\ndesigns in future research on AI in HR.\\nChapter 20 “Employing artificial intelligence in human resources research” written by \\nChulin Chen and Richard Landers deals with the potential of AI for use in HR research. Given \\nAI’s improved capabilities to detect associations and relationships within data beyond tradi -\\ntional statistical tools, its scholarly applications are on the one hand obvious and promising yet \\non the other hand imply many challenges regarding validity, reliability, and ethics. Focusing \\non machine learning, the chapter provides guidance on how AI can be used to advance \\nresearch on HR topics, reviews existing HR applications, and highlights research gaps and \\nfuture research directions.\\nREFERENCES\\nAhmed, I., Sultana, I., Paul, S.
