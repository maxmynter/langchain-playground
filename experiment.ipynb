As our under-\\nstanding has increased, so have our theories changed: Geome trical optics, wave optics and quantum\\noptics are increasingly sophisticated descriptions, each referring to a larger class of phenomena than\\nits predecessor. But how exactly are these theories related ? How and when wave optics reduces to\\ngeometric optics is a rather simple problem. Similarly, how quantum optics reduces to wave optics\\nhas been considered to be a very simple business as well. It’s not so. As we show here the classical\\nlimit of quantum optics is a far more complicated issue; it is in fact dramatically more involved and\\nit requires a complete revision of all our intuitions. The re vised intuitions can then serve as a guide\\nto ﬁnding novel quantum eﬀects.\\nInventing a new theory of nature requires, as R. Feyn-\\nmansaid, “imaginationinaterriblestrait-jacket”[1]. Un-\\nliketheartistwhoneed notobeyconstraints,asscientists\\nwe are not free to imagine whatever we want - the new\\ntheory must obey a “correspondence principle”. It must,\\nobviously, give diﬀerent predictions from those of the old\\ntheoryforsomephenomena, but at thesametime it must\\nagree with the old theory in all the places in which the\\nold theory was already experimentally veriﬁed. For all\\nthose experiments the new theory must give numerical\\nresults that are very similar to those of the old theory;\\nthe only acceptable diﬀerence must be smaller than the\\nprecision of the measurements that seemed to conﬁrm\\nthe old theory.\\nInsofar as the numerical predictions of a theory are\\nconcerned, the correspondence principle is fairly obvi-\\nous and straightforward. However, theories are not only\\nmathematical devices for making numerical predictions -\\nthey contain concepts that tell us a story of what the na-\\nture of physical reality is. And, as Feynman also noted,\\neven in situations when the numerical predictions of two\\ntheories are almost identical, the concepts they involve\\nmay be completely diﬀerent. Indeed, it is a fundamental\\nconceptual diﬀerence between, say, mass being an abso-\\nlute constant or mass changingwith the speed even when\\nthe speed is so low that the change of mass is negligible.\\nYet, and this is the point that concerns us here, al-\\nthough the concepts of the two theories are completely\\ndiﬀerent, andremaindiﬀerentevenintheregimeinwhich\\nthe two theories give almost identical numerical predic-\\ntions, it seems to be the case that the story told by the\\nnew theory relates in rather simple waysto the story told\\nby the old theory. For example, although mass changes\\nwith speed, at low speeds it changes only very little -\\nit has a certain simple continuity relation with the old\\nstory of absolute constant mass. It doesn’t have to be so\\n- there is no need of any “continuity” at the conceptual\\nlevel, only the numerical predictions have to agree in theregime where the old theory was already veriﬁed - but\\nthe history of science seems to suggest that this is always\\nthe case.\\nEventhe classicallimit ofquantummechanicsseemsto\\nbe rather benign - with increasing mass, wavepacketscan\\nbe taken narrower and narrower yet they will take longer\\nandlongertospread,soparticlescanbebetterandbetter\\nlocalized.

Fol-\\nlowing this paradigmaticexample, it is tempting to think\\nthat the classical-quantum transition follows a rather\\nsimple pattern. Nothing, however, can be further from\\nthe truth, as we show below.\\nConsider the interferometric experiment described in\\nFig.2. The three mirrors used in the experiment are per-\\nfectly reﬂecting, with mirror M being silvered on both\\nsides. The diﬀerence between this arrangement and a\\nstandard interferometer is that one of the beams emerg-\\ning from the interferometer, does not directly enter the\\ncorresponding detector (D 1). Rather, it is ﬁrst reﬂected\\nby a supplementary mirroronto the mirrorM which then\\nreﬂects it towards the detector. Mirror M receives there-\\nfore two momentum kicks, one from the light inside the\\ninterferometer and one from the beam that reﬂects on it\\nfrom the outside. The focus ofinterest in this experiment\\nis the momentum received by the mirror M.\\nThe incidence angles of the inside and outside light\\nbeams onto M are chosen such that cos β=1\\n2cosα. The\\nbeamsplitters BS 1and BS 2are identical, having reﬂec-\\ntivityrand transmissivity t, both given by real numbers\\nwithr2+t2= 1, and r > t.

Thecalculationabovewasdoneusing\\nclassical optics, but a straightforward quantum calcula-\\ntion obviously leads to the same result. The issue how-\\never is with the story each theory has to tell. According\\nto the classical optics description of the experiment, the\\nstoryis very simple. Lightimpinges on M from two sides.\\nAlthoughtheexternalbeamhasashallowerincidencean-\\ngle than the inside beam, its intensity is much higher and\\noverallthemomentumkickgivenbyitislarger,hencethe\\nmirroris pushed inwards. We thereforeconclude that the\\nexternal beam impinging on M plays the central role - it\\nis due to it that the mirror is pushed inwards. Hence one\\nwould be tempted to assume that quantum mechanically\\nthe photons that constitute this beam are the ones re-\\nsponsible for the inward push. Remarkably, this is not\\nso.\\nLet us now analyze in detail the momentum given to\\nthe mirror by the photons that end up at D 1and at\\nD2. Each photon incident on M gives it a momentum\\nkickδ. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that each individual\\nmomentum kick is much smaller than the spread ∆ of\\nmomentum of the mirror. This is a general property of\\nany interferometer. It has to be so in order to maintain\\nthe coherenceofthe light inthe interferometer; otherwise\\nthe photons will become entangled with the mirror. To\\nshowthis, wenotethataphotonwhengoingthrougharm\\nA will produce no kick to M while when going through\\narm B will produce a kick. Accordingly, if φ(p) is the ini-\\ntial quantum state of the mirror and by |Ψ/angbracketrightthe quantum\\nstate of the photon after the input beamsplitter BS1, but\\nbefore reaching the mirror, the reﬂection on the mirror\\nresults in\\n|Ψ/angbracketrightφ(p) = (ir|A/angbracketright+t|B/angbracketright)φ(p)→ir|A/angbracketrightφ(p)+t|B/angbracketrightφ(p−δ).\\n(6)\\nIfφ(p) is orthogonal to φ(p−δ) whereδ= 2/planckover2pi1ωcosαis\\nthe kick given by the photon, then the photon ends up\\nentangled with the mirror and coherence is lost. Another\\nway of looking at this is to note that the mirror has to be\\nlocalized within a distance smaller than the wavelength\\nof light, otherwise there will be phase ﬂuctuations larger\\nthan 2πand interference is lost. (In fact the spread ∆\\nin the momentum of the mirror has to be many times\\nbigger - of order√\\nntimes - than that of an individual\\nkick to ensure coherence when a beam with an averageof\\nnphotons and a spread√\\nngoes through the interferom-\\neter. At the same time ∆, being of order√\\nnδ, is smallenough so that the average kick, which is of order nδis\\ndetectable.)\\nFor simplicity we take the state of the mirror to be\\n(up to normalisation) φ(p) = exp(−p2\\n2∆2).

Classi-\\ncally it is the light in the D 1beam that is responsible\\nfor giving the mirror the kick towards the inside of the\\ninterferometer. Indeed, it is only this beam that can give\\na momentum in this direction. The light in the inter-\\nferometer can either give no momentum (beam A), or a\\nmomentum towards the exterior (beam B). It was there-\\nfore tempting to assume that quantum mechanically it\\nis also the case that the photons in the D 1beam are\\nthose responsible for the eﬀect. What we found how-\\never is that the photons that end up in the D 1beam\\nhave overall no eﬀect whatsoever - the momentum they\\ngive when colliding with the mirror from the outside is\\nexactly compensated by the momentum they gave the\\nmirror while inside the interferometer, so the total mo-\\nmentum they give is strictly zero. In fact, according to\\nquantum mechanics, it is the photons that end up in the\\nD2beam that give the momentum kick. Astonishingly,\\nalthoughtheycollidewiththemirroronlyfromtheinside\\nof the interferometer, they do not push the mirror out-\\nwards; rather they somehow succeed to pull it in! This\\nis realized by a superposition of giving the mirror zero\\nmomentum and positive momentum - the superposition\\nresults in the mirror gaining negative momentum.\\nAs mentioned before, our analysis is not limited to in-\\nterpretational issues. It also serves as a guide for our\\nintuition. Suppose that, by a quantum ﬂuctuation, we\\nreceive more than the average number of photons at de-\\ntector D 1. The classical intuition will led us to expect\\nthat now the mirror will receive an even larger momen-\\ntum inwards. Our analysis above tells us diﬀerently -\\nsince the eﬀect is due to photons going towards D 2and\\nnow there are fewer of them, the inward momentum will\\nbe smaller.\\nAcknowledgments This work was supported in part\\nby the Binational Science Foundation Grant 32/08, the', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/classical-limit-of-quantum-optics.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet.

In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1;:::;x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1;:::;z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1;:::;y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

We employ a residual connection [ 10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\n3', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q;K;V ) = softmax(QKT\\npdk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pdk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n\\x0fIn \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n\\x0fThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n\\x0fSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \\x001) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0;xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights bypdmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/attention.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1;:::;x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1;:::;z n), withxi;zi2Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations.

We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k\\x01n\\x01d+n\\x01d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] with\\x0c1= 0:9,\\x0c2= 0:98and\\x0f= 10\\x009.

We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks.
